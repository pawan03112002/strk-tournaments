## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Add Your Payment Details**

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add:

```env
# Your UPI Details
VITE_UPI_ID=yourname@paytm
VITE_UPI_QR_CODE_URL=/upi-qr-code.png

# Your Bank Details
VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME=Your Full Name
VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=1234567890
VITE_BANK_IFSC=SBIN0001234
VITE_BANK_NAME=State Bank of India
VITE_BANK_BRANCH=Main Branch

# Keep your existing Firebase and EmailJS keys...
```

### **Step 2: Add UPI QR Code Image**

1. Generate your UPI QR code:
   - Open any UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm)
   - Go to "Receive Money" or "QR Code"
   - Save/Screenshot your QR code

2. Save the image:
   - Place it in: `public/upi-qr-code.png`
   - Or upload to online storage and use URL

### **Step 3: Update Router** (IMPORTANT)

Add these routes to your `App.jsx` or router file:

```javascript
import ManualPayment from './pages/ManualPayment'
import PaymentPending from './pages/PaymentPending'
import PaymentVerification from './pages/PaymentVerification'

// Add these routes:
<Route path="/manual-payment" element={<ManualPayment />} />
<Route path="/payment-pending" element={<PaymentPending />} />
<Route path="/admin/payment-verification" element={<PaymentVerification />} />
```

### **Step 4: Update Registration Page**

In your `TournamentRegistration.jsx`, replace payment gateway code with:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

const navigate = useNavigate()

// In your payment handler:
const handlePayment = () => {
  // Pass registration data to payment page
  navigate('/manual-payment', {
    state: {
      registrationData: {
        teamName: formData.teamName,
        contactEmail: formData.contactEmail,
        contactNumber: formData.contactNumber
      }
    }
  })
}
```

## 💰 Fee Structure

### **No Payment Gateway Fees!**

**Before (With Razorpay/Stripe):**
```
Entry Fee: ₹500
Gateway Fee: ₹10-17 (2-3%)
You receive: ₹483-490
```

**Now (Manual):**
```
Entry Fee: ₹500
Gateway Fee: ₹0 (0%)
You receive: ₹500
```

**You save 100% of gateway fees!**
