# PhonePe Payment Gateway Setup Guide

## üì± Overview

This project now uses **PhonePe Payment Gateway** for Indian payments (INR) instead of Razorpay. PhonePe is a popular UPI-based payment platform in India.

## üîë Getting Started with PhonePe

### Step 1: Create PhonePe Business Account

1. Visit [PhonePe Business](https://business.phonepe.com/)
2. Sign up for a business account
3. Complete KYC verification
4. Submit required business documents

### Step 2: Get API Credentials

Once your account is approved, you'll receive:
- **Merchant ID**: Your unique merchant identifier
- **Salt Key**: Secret key for API authentication
- **Salt Index**: Index number (usually 1)

### Step 3: Choose Environment

PhonePe offers two environments:

1. **Sandbox (UAT)** - For testing
   - API Endpoint: `https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/pg-sandbox`
   - Use test cards and UPI IDs
   - No real money transactions

2. **Production** - For live payments
   - API Endpoint: `https://api.phonepe.com/apis/hermes`
   - Real money transactions
   - Requires approval from PhonePe

## üîß Configuration

### Update Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# PhonePe Configuration
VITE_PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id_here
VITE_PHONEPE_SALT_KEY=your_salt_key_here
VITE_PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX=1
VITE_PHONEPE_ENV=sandbox

# For backend only - keep this secret!
PHONEPE_SALT_KEY=your_salt_key_here

# Base URL for callbacks
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://strk-tournaments.vercel.app
```

### Vercel Environment Variables

Add these in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

1. `VITE_PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID` - Your Merchant ID
2. `VITE_PHONEPE_SALT_KEY` - Your Salt Key (frontend)
3. `PHONEPE_SALT_KEY` - Your Salt Key (backend - keep secret!)
4. `VITE_PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX` - Usually `1`
5. `VITE_PHONEPE_ENV` - `sandbox` or `production`
6. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - Your website URL

## üìã How PhonePe Integration Works

### Payment Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
   ‚Üì
2. Frontend calls /api/create-phonepe-payment
   ‚Üì
3. Backend creates payment request with PhonePe
   ‚Üì
4. PhonePe returns redirect URL
   ‚Üì
5. User is redirected to PhonePe payment page
   ‚Üì
6. User completes payment (UPI/Card/Netbanking)
   ‚Üì
7. PhonePe redirects back to your website
   ‚Üì
8. Frontend calls /api/check-phonepe-status
   ‚Üì
9. Backend verifies payment with PhonePe
   ‚Üì
10. Show success/failure message
```

### Key Differences from Razorpay:

| Feature | Razorpay | PhonePe |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **UI** | Modal popup | Full page redirect |
| **Script** | Requires JS SDK | API-only (no script) |
| **Payment** | Inline checkout | Redirect to PhonePe |
| **Verification** | Webhook + API | API status check |
| **Fee** | 2% + GST | Competitive rates |

## üß™ Testing in Sandbox

### Test UPI IDs:
- `success@ybl` - Successful payment
- `failure@ybl` - Failed payment

### Test Cards:
PhonePe provides test card numbers in their dashboard.

### Test Flow:
1. Set `VITE_PHONEPE_ENV=sandbox`
2. Use test credentials
3. Complete payment with test UPI/card
4. Verify in PhonePe sandbox dashboard

## üöÄ Going Live

### Checklist:

- [ ] Complete business KYC
- [ ] Get production credentials
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Set `VITE_PHONEPE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Test with small amount first
- [ ] Monitor PhonePe dashboard
- [ ] Set up webhooks (optional)

### Production Deployment:

```bash
# 1. Update .env
VITE_PHONEPE_ENV=production

# 2. Update Vercel environment variables
# Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
# Change VITE_PHONEPE_ENV to "production"

# 3. Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## üìä Payment Status Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `PAYMENT_SUCCESS` | Success | Payment completed |
| `PAYMENT_PENDING` | Pending | Payment in progress |
| `PAYMENT_DECLINED` | Failed | Payment declined |
| `PAYMENT_ERROR` | Failed | Technical error |
| `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND` | Error | Invalid transaction ID |

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's:
- Keep `PHONEPE_SALT_KEY` secret (backend only)
- Use HTTPS for all callbacks
- Verify payment on backend
- Log all transactions
- Implement rate limiting

### ‚ùå Don'ts:
- Don't expose salt key in frontend
- Don't trust frontend payment status
- Don't skip signature verification
- Don't hardcode credentials
