## 🚀 What You Need to Do (10 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Create .env File** (2 min)

Create a file named `.env` in your project root:

```env
# Firebase (keep your existing values)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_existing_value
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_existing_value
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_existing_value
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_existing_value
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_existing_value
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_existing_value

# Manual Payment - ADD YOUR DETAILS HERE
VITE_UPI_ID=yourname@paytm
VITE_UPI_QR_CODE_URL=/upi-qr-code.png

VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME=Your Full Name
VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=1234567890
VITE_BANK_IFSC=SBIN0001234
VITE_BANK_NAME=State Bank of India
VITE_BANK_BRANCH=Main Branch

# Admin Password (keep existing)
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# EmailJS (keep existing if you have)
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_existing_value
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_existing_value
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_existing_value
```

### **Step 2: Add UPI QR Code** (2 min)

1. Open any UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm)
2. Go to "Receive Money" or "Show QR"
3. Save/Screenshot your QR code
4. Save as: `public/upi-qr-code.png`

### **Step 3: Update Router** (3 min)

**Find your router file** (probably `App.jsx` or `src/App.jsx`):

**Add these imports at the top:**
```javascript
import ManualPayment from './pages/ManualPayment'
import PaymentPending from './pages/PaymentPending'
import PaymentVerification from './pages/PaymentVerification'
```

**Add these routes:**
```javascript
<Route path="/manual-payment" element={<ManualPayment />} />
<Route path="/payment-pending" element={<PaymentPending />} />
<Route path="/admin/payment-verification" element={<PaymentVerification />} />
```

### **Step 4: Update Registration Payment Handler** (3 min)

**Find your `TournamentRegistration.jsx` file:**

**Replace payment gateway code with:**
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'

// At the top of your component:
const navigate = useNavigate()

// In your payment handler function:
const handlePayment = () => {
  // Navigate to manual payment page
  navigate('/manual-payment', {
    state: {
      registrationData: {
        teamName: formData.teamName,
        contactEmail: formData.contactEmail,
        contactNumber: formData.contactNumber
      }
    }
  })
}
```

**Or if you have a "Pay Now" button, update it:**
```javascript
<button onClick={handlePayment}>
  Pay Now - ₹500
</button>
```
